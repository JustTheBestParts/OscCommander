# OSC Commander #


OSC Commander is a Processing sketch written as part of the book, Just the Best Parts: OSC for Artists 

[http://www.justthebestparts.com/books/osc/](http://www.justthebestparts.com/books/osc/)



It allows you to send OSC messages to an OSC server of your choice.

You can either use the "OSC message" field to send arbitrary messages, or use any of the slider controls to send OSC messages mimicing those sent by TouchOSC.
